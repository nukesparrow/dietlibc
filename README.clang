clang (from LLVM) can be used to compile against dietlibc, but it can
not be used to compile dietlibc itself.  The reason is that dietlibc
uses gas (the GNU assembler, part of binutils) features in the assembly
parts that are not yet supported by clang.

The build process compensates by passing -fno-integrated-as to clang,
but that makes compilation with clang much slower than compilation with
gcc.

Still, the end result appears to work.
